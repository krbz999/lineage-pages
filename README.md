Organize multiple compendiums of dnd5e races into one window where your players can see what is available to them.

When installed a 'dna' button is viewable in the left-hand side. This opens the main pages. A settings menu in the header lets a GM configure the sources that the races are pulled from, as well as configure the general look of the application. The pages are automatically populated with every race from your compendiums that you add to the 'Sources' configuration menu.
